# ATTENTION-FUEL PORTAL

## Purpose of this site:
With the emergence of the so called 'Attention Economy," YouTube has increasingly proved to be a source of distraction rather than benefaction to my study sessions.

What once before was a library of free knowledge, tutorials and expert guidance for new ways of thinking became a purgatory of information addiction, shallow learning and misinformation. It's clear that the more I use youtube for background music, the less the quality of my study sessions because.

This site serves as an intermediate in the hope that it will reframe my mind to not indulge in video addiction by only containing the useful content from youtube. Instead of opening up youtube, whenever background music or ambience is required, this portal will be used. 

## Contents of this site:

The site is divided into 6 sections:
* Calm. OSTs and ambiences that are emotionally neutral and is best used for study sessions requiring maximal brain power.
* Exploration. Upbeat OSTs and ambience that are a balance between calm and intense.
* Somber. Sad OSTs and ambience that are a balance between calm and mystery.
* Mystery. OSTs and ambiences that sets an investigative mood and is best used when you're trying to figure new things out.
* Intense. OST and ambiences with an aura of excitement and thriller, best used for powering through sessions when you don't feel like it.
* Pianist current. Piano pieces you're currently learning. Listening to them repeatedly helps in performance when playing said pieces. Best used for break sessions.
* Pianist classics. Classical piano pieces you're planning to learn. Listen to them in advance to get familiarised with them. Works both both break and study sessions.

NOTE: For soundtracks with local copies directly from the source material, the source material will be used instead of youtube videos.
